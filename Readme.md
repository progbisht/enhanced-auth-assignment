# Assignment (Enhanced Authentication API)

In this assignment I have improved the existing backend API for an authentication system to include a new feature allowing users to set their profiles as public or private. Additionally, I have implemented functionality to allow admin users to view both public and private user profiles, while normal users can only access public profiles. 

## Requirements
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side code.
- Express.js: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- MongoDB: Database for data persistence.

## Versions
- Node - v20.9.0
- npm - 10.1.0

- Rest can be fetched from package.json

## Usage
